# The Triangle Puzzle

I came across an interesting mathematical puzzle, namely, find the value of the angle ùúô in the triangle shown in the figure below. It turns out that it's a surprisingly non-trivial problem to solve. I like a mathematical challenge so... I solved a more general version of the problem, where the angles at the bottom are arbitrary.
